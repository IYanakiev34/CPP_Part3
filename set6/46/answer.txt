Why is there no minimal match feature in flexc++:
  1) It's a sign that you are trying to do parsing in a lexer, which is not
    what it's used for
  2) You can do non-greedy matching regardless manually. For your pattern,
    enter a StartCondition once you hit the start of your pattern. Then parse
    till you hit the accepting state of your pattern and immediately pop the
    start condition.
