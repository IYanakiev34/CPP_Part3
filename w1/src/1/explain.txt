In order to verify that although we instantiate
the add template into two source files but end up
with the same function we need to point and print
to the function address. We create a union called
PointerUnion which will instantiate the template
for type int and keep its address. Thus in main
we can see we call both fun and instantiate the
add template again. So we have 2 instantiations
in 2 source files but yet the output shows the
same function address.
