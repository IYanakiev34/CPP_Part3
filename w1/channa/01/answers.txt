The output of running the compiled project:

    Address of instantiated template function in sourceFun1: 0x561940f86312
    Address of instantiated template function in sourceFun2: 0x561940f86312

Observe that even though we compiled source1, source2 separately (and thus
contain their own instantiations of tempFun<int>), the address of this function
is the same.
