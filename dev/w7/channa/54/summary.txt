In this exercise, we construct a grammar to accept either:
- A list of WORD tokens that are separated by spaces
- A list of WORD tokens that are separated by commas

However, we do not accept lists that separate by both spaces and commas.

grammaropt contains a grammar for lists that can have 0 or more words
grammarreq contains a grammar for lists that can have 1 or more words.
