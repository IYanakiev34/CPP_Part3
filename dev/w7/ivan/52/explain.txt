For the "!=" we can just add a token
and return in in the lexer. We then
proceed to place the %left NOTEQ above
the multiplication sign (assuming that
"!=" is left associative). For the "^"
we can just keep it as a symbol and define
if like %right '^' this should be above the
unary minus rule and below the multiplication.
