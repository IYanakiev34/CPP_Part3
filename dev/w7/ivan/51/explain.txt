The grammar given to us had a reduce reduce conflict.
This is due to the fact that we have a reduction
based on the terminal NUMBER and the non-terminal
number. The non terminal number expands to NUMBER,
this creates confusion in the parser if it should
go in the rule for the non terminal or reduce.
R/R conflicts could be solved easily by resolving
ambiguity in the grammar. In our case this could be
done by either remove NUMBER or number. Since both
produce the same expression effectively which is NUMBER.
