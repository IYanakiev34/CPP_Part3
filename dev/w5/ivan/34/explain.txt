In this exercise we need to create
a concept that will verify that a container
of specified type has an index operator
which return a reference to the items.
In order to do this we create a concept
in the following way:
    template <template <typename> Container,typename Data>

This solved the header so now we can use it with 
containers. No we just need to define that when
we use the index operator we return:
    Data &
In order to do that we could use the std::same_as
in combination with the index operator.
