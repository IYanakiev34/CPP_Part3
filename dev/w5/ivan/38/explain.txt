In order to solve the exercise
we define a very basic math concept that
could handle the basic mathematical operations
in any order of the types passed. We then
proceed to create the operations classes
which will be templated on the two types
and require the concept that we have define.
Each of them will have a static method
which will apply the operation specified.
In order to use the math function we will
need a general function template,base case,
and one where we expand the first arg. The most
general case will be the one originally
callled. It only needs an operations and arguments.
Then we need one where we know the first,
second and rest arguments. we will apply the
operation on the first and second and 
recursively call the function again with
the first and the rest of the arguments.
Once we have only the first argument left
we simply print a new line. This is the
base case of the function.
