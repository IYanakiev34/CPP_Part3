In order to solve the exercise we define
two simple concepts: Add and Mul.
If we want to use either one of them
or both we could create a concept: AddMul
and utilize "or" operator on concepts.
This will allow us to have a concept like
    Add<Type> or Mul<Type>
In order to have a concept when only one
of the conditions is valid we could
define it like this:
    (Mul<Type> and not Add<Type>) or
    (Add<Type> and not Mul<Type>)
