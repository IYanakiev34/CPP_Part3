In order to define such a concept we need
two template parameters for the two types
that we will pass in. We can name them:
        Lhs and Rhs
After we have defined the template header
we move on to the concept definition. We
need to make sure that the two values of
the types passed could perform the following
operations:
    lhs + rhs;
    lhs - rhs;
    lhs * rhs;
    lhs / rhs;
    -lhs;
    -rhs;

After that we could simply create a function
template and require the concept. With the 
main program that we have set up the compiler
gives an error since it cannot add an integer
and a string. The error message is clear thanks
to the concept.
