In this exercise we need to develop
a concept which checks if we could
dereference a type. To do this we
need to check if we could use the
"*" operator on the type. In order
to enforce the template on a class
we could simply use the 
    requires <concept name> <types...>
syntax on the class after the template
header. This will require the concept.
On function template we have more than 
once option. We could either use:
    template < <conceptName> Name>
    void fun(Name data)
        or

    template <typename Data>
    requires <concept-name> <Data>
    void fun(Data data)

There is also the option of implicit
function template declaration but I did
not go for it.
