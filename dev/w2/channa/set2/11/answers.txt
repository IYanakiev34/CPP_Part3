You could create a Counter class, which the template type has a member
variable. The Counter class contains static variables, and its default
constructor increments the `count` / `actual` variables, and its destructor
decrements the `actual` variable.

Then, any construction of any template class instantiation results in the
variables being incremented and a destruction results in a decrement of the
`actual` variable. This way, we do not tie our tracking to a specific
instantiation.
