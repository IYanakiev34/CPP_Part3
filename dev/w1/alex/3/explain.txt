Modeled rawCapacity based on the use of placement new on
page 250 of annotations, just changing string to T. Then
I reserve the capacity for 10 strings and use placement new
to insert a string at the fourth spot. I print the value at
the fourth spot and confirm output:
    This is what I want to print
Placement new is unique in that you have to manually call
the destructors of objects placed there if said objects have
side effects and string does allocate memory. Hence, I
explicitly call the destructor of the string I placed, then
use operator delete. With these two considerations, the
peculiarities of placement new (page 227) are handled and
valgrind reports no leaks.
