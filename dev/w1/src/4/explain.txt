In order to create the function forwarder
we will need to make sure we have 2 things
present. A typename for the function that we
will pass in. Also we will need the parameters.
This could be done as follows:

template <typename Function,typename Params&&...>
We pass the params as univesal reference in order
to accomodate the variables as needed. We then
just need to invoke the function passed in
and forward the parameters to it. One more
tricky thing is the return type of the function
since it depends on the function that we pass in.
One thing that we could do is to use:

decltype(auto) for return type
