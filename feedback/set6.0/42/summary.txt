In this exercise, we tokenize our input stream according to C++ identifiers,
integers, doubles, etc. We then output the token values followed by the
text that resulted in the tokens.

Note that the scanner, when tokenizing a STRING token, does not process the
matched text to result in an actual string. This is because the program wants
to output the _actual text_ that resulted in the token, and not the string that
the matched text would create after concatenation.
