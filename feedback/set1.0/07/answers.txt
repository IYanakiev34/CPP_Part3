JB: ?
Why should the operator<< function template (in printSet) not specify the
second operand as &&?
    1) Because universe / subsets is a const object, and std::set<ElemT> is not
        a const parameter type, there can be no match.
	JB: Doesn't the '&&' specify a forwarding reference, then?
    2) If you try to match the whole set, i.e:
        std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &out, SetT const &toOut)
        this will actually overload the existing << operator on ostreams,
        leading to ambiguities.
       JB: But... we *are* overloading operator<<, with a template.
       JB: Perhaps I'm misunderstanding this answer.
