In this exercise, we define a simple grammar that accepts a sequence of
zero or more function calls of write, which takes it one or more arguments
that are variables / numbers.

Note: We only hand in Scanner.ih from the generated files from flexc++, as that
is the only file we modify from what it generates. We do not submit any
generated files from bisonc++ since we do not modify any of files it generates.
