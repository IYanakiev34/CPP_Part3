In this exercise, we extend an existing calculator to contain commands
"quit" and "exit" to quit the calculator and the command "list" to list the
variables and their associated values.

We only provide the (decorated) grammar and lexer to support this program, and
not the implementation of the decorator functions (as we are only asked for
specification files).
